        In my senior year in high school, I took two classes about programming, but after all, <br>
        I didn't really feel like I learned anything useful from it, it might be because they <br>
        are blow-off classes.  And before every senior graduate, they have to do a presentation <br>
        about what career they want to do in the future and what they are doing to approach, <br>
        then I think of the two programming classes that I'm taking, after all that's what I've <br>
        decided to major in computer science.
